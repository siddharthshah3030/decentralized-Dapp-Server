# Smart Elections
#### project by team Pro at I_HACK Hackathon E-Summit'19 IIT Bombay
### This repository **decentralized-Dapp-Server** is main server for Smart Contract, API, Database, UI-Result

Smart Elections is a voting system based on Decentralised Ethereum Blockchain Network. An attempt to improve India's current election system using Ethereum Blockchain Network.

  - NO more Biasing in votes
  -  the authenticity to every voter and candidate via Smart Transaction
  - votes are decentralized and distributed across a peer-to-peer network for security

### problem statement:
> **India's EVMs are Vulnerable to Fraud**
> a research [article](https://indiaevm.org/qa.html) have claimed many ways to temper vote.

> **The question arises - why we even do voting in India?**
> some temper proof solution needs to be made for secure and fair Elections and Voting,
> so that user is sure their vote is not being tempered,
> we came up with this great solution  


Our project uses Blockchain and Smart Etherum contracts to make sure each and every vote is being stored peer to peer in a decentralized network with Hashing so that every vote is secured and elections are fair

## Simple Steps :
 1)  **Verify User** - Use some Biometric user verification (currently not implemeneted)
 2)  **Take Vote** - Take vote via IOT devce based on rasberry Pi 3 
  3)  **Make Smart Contract** - Store the vote via Smart-Contract in Etherum network 
 4)  **Results** - Count the total votes in network 


## Complete project :-
Being a large and team project there are multiple repositories for individual stack and field

 - #### [decentralized-Dapp-Server](https://github.com/siddharthshah3030/decentralized-Dapp-Server)(this)- main server for Smart Contract, API, Database, UI-Result  
- #### [Smart-Elections_Solidity](https://github.com/Shritesh99/Smart-Elections_Solidity) - consists of etherum side smart contract code 
- #### [Smart_elections_rasp](https://github.com/utkarshchandrakar/Smart_elections_rasp) - voting machine based on Raspberry Pi 3 for taking votes from voters
- #### [Smart-Elections-Server](https://github.com/siddharthshah3030/Smart-Elections-Server) - old main server (Smart Contract, API, Database, UI-Result)
